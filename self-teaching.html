            <h1>Self-taught anything. A guide to teaching yourself.</h1>
            <p>In today&#39;s world, information and knowledge are freely available to almost anyone. Young people today
                have easier access than ever to obtain knowledge about topics that interest them. Reading this guide will
                provide you with an outline of the principles and strategies that make it possible to teach yourself any
                skill, taking full advantage of the internet-driven age we live in today.</p>
            <p>If you believe that you have a hard time teaching yourself and often require someone else to teach you, this
                guide will offer advice and prove that with the right approach, anyone can become a successful autodidact.

            <p>Autodidacts are individuals who have learned a skill or various skills on their own without relying on formal
                instruction from others. Let&#39;s explore some factors that make being an autodidact particularly
                advantageous in today’s cultural climate.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Flawed Educational Systems</strong>: Many countries have compulsory education systems that often
                    fall short in terms of quality and relevance. Despite ongoing efforts to reform and modernize education,
                    there remains a strong desire among individuals to go beyond what is taught in schools and educate
                    themselves in more meaningful and personalized ways.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Barriers</strong>: The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical
                    conflicts have led to high inflation, making it difficult for many students to afford one-on-one
                    tutoring. Online platforms like Udemy, Coursera, and Khan Academy provide structured, affordable, and
                    even free educational opportunities that can replace expensive traditional tutoring.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Given the right mindset, you can use these resources to acquire professional-level skills and certifications
                that were previously only accessible through traditional academic routes.</p>
            <p>Being able to teach yourself requires you to adapt a <a href="https://fs.blog/carol-dweck-mindset/">Growth
                    Mindset</a> having such a mindset is crucial to success when it comes to overcoming hurdles on your own
                and pushing through the often hard and challenging experiences that come with learning any new skill. <a
                    href="https://149664534.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Carol-Dweck-Two-Mindsets.jpg">Info-graphic
                    comparing the fixed mindset with the growth mindset</a></p>
            <p>One important pillar of the growth-mindset and one of main the requirements when it comes to teaching
                yourself is embracing the idea of <em>&quot;yet...&quot;</em>. </p>
            <p>There might have been times where you have tried to learn something only to feel like you aren&#39;t smart
                enough, not ready, incapable, not made for it or otherwise. You most likely gave up and are now critical of
                this article trying to find something that proves your idea right, that this is just another &quot;you can
                do it if only you try hard enough!&quot; type of article.</p>
            <p>Well congratulations, you developed a fixed mindset. This is the opposite of what you should aim for. People
                with a growth mindset are aware of the self-doubt
                that they will inevitably be confronted with and use &quot;yet...&quot; in order to pick themselves back up
                from the ground and keep moving forward.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>I cannot do it... yet... </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>See how that simple shift in thinking now makes you confident all of a sudden and you feel like you can do
                anything? Well.. that&#39;s the mindset. You&#39;re welcome.</p>

            <p>Now that you are in the correct mindset and your confidence is high, it is important to emphasize the need
                for setting realistic goals. While I claim that you can teach yourself <em>any</em> skill, it is also
                important to consider the amount of time you are willing to spend on it, your personal expectations and your
                already pre-existing knowledge in the field.</p>
            <p>In order to help you set a realistic goal I want to recommend you creating a <a

            <p>The internet is filled with resources. No matter what you want to learn about you are likely to find a
                healthy mixture of audio / video and written content on the internet for free. In this section i want to
                give you an idea about how to properly pick your resources and how to avoid common pitfalls that make this
                section of the guide the area <strong>where most people are failing</strong> when it comes to learning
                things on their own.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>If possible completely avoid &quot;tutorial&quot; videos. Why? Tutorial videos often include a lot of
                        pre-scripted, hand-selected examples, watching the videos gives you the illusion of learning
                        something, yet the most important part, applying the learned content yourself is often something
                        that either never happens, or if it does, it&#39;s a plain copy of the demonstrated example. Because
                        of this I do not recommend you to consume tutorial videos and completely avoid the viscous circle of
                        <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tutorial%20Hell">Tutorial Hell.</a>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Embrace written content as it gives you an opportunity to read while actively applying the things you
                        have read about. I know reading is boring... but... reading and applying, reading and applying, gets
                        rid of the boredom that often comes from reading highly scientific or technical content and allows
                        you to learn at your own pace. If you get stuck, read it again and it sticks, if you apply it
                        correctly, awesome, keep reading. Win-win! <a

            <h3 id="creating-a-learning-plan">Creating a learning-plan.</h3>
            <p>A well-structured learning plan is crucial for effective self-education. It provides a roadmap for your
                journey, helping you stay organized, motivated, and on track. Here’s how you can create an effective
                learning plan:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Learn at your own pace:</strong> Your learning plan should be flexible not restrictive, if you
                    don&#39;t have the ability to schedule fixed times for practice you can look into flexible planning
                    techniques based on smaller weekly goals.</li>
                <li><strong>Allocate time</strong>: When sitting down to learn, eliminate every single possible distraction
                    and aim to fully focus all of your mental capacity towards what you are trying to learn, fully focused
                    sessions will save you time and help you make progress much more reliably and quickly compared to being
                    regularly distracted.</li>
                <li><strong>Micro-learning</strong>: Do not aim to learn entire concepts in one sessions, embrace the SMART
                    goals mentioned earlier and focus on small and easily achievable tasks that help you stay motivated and
                    reduce the likelihood of you feeling overwhelmed. If possible set your micro-goals to fit into <a

            <h3 id="the-importance-of-practice">The importance of *deliberate* practice.</h3>
            <p>Consuming knowledge is alone is not going to get you very far. In-fact when it comes to teaching yourself any
                skill the importance of deliberate practice and the profound impact
                it can have on your learning experience is often underestimated. Deliberate practice is a highly structured,
                goal-oriented form of active learning that requires you to focus intently on a specific skill or concept.
                Here are some tips to help you practice effectively:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Challenge yourself:</strong> Push yourself out of your comfort zone by tackling difficult tasks
                    and do not shy away from making mistakes. Mistakes are a natural part of the learning process and
                    provide valuable feedback for improvement. If the resources you are using do not provide you with
                    challenging tasks, consider looking for additional resources that do.</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on quality, not quantity:</strong> Practice with intention and purpose, focusing on
                    refining your skills and understanding rather than simply going through the motions. Quality practice is
                    more effective than mindless repetition. Watching the same section of the lecture over and over again is
                    fine, copying the path to the solution is not.</li>
                <li><strong>Seek feedback:</strong> Ask for feedback from others, or record yourself practicing to review
                    your performance. Feedback helps you identify areas for improvement and refine your skills. And
                    recording yourself helps you keep yourself accountable and make you aware of potential distractions.
                </li>

                <h3 id="the-importance-of-community">Overcoming challenges</h3>
                <p>As self-taught individuals, because we are lacking the classic classroom environment, getting feedback is
                    not as easy as it seems. And so as part of this journey one finds themselves stuck and frustrated often.
                    When encountering challenges in your personal learning journey remember that every single challenge,
                    every single obstacle is temporary, and that the path beyond is absolutely worth the effort required to
                    overcome it. </p>
                <p>Do not give up, instead acknowledge that you hit a roadblock, figure out what you need to get better at
                    to overcome it and take a detour.</p>
                <p>Remember that the journey of teaching yourself is a marathon, not a sprint. It is a long-term commitment
                    that requires patience, persistence, and resilience. </p>
                <p>Learning on your own can be a lonely and isolating experience, but it doesn’t have to be. Engaging with
                    communities of like-minded individuals can provide you with support, motivation, and valuable insights.
                </p>
                <p>Don't forget to leverage communities like ours in which you can meet various people looking to improve
                    their lives along with you improving yours. Most of the time when one encounters a lack of motivation,
                    given the right mix of rest and communication they are able to return to their path relatively quickly.

                <h3>Leveraging technology *properly*</h3>
                <p>Technology has revolutionized the way we learn, making it easier than ever to access information and
                    resources. With how many time-managment and learning tools are available today it is important to
                    evaluate which tools contribute to your path towards mastery and which do not.</p>
                <p>A common mistake many self-learners run into is their over-reliance on or micro-management of
                    productivity tools. Spending time setting up your learning app / calendar / to-do list is great. But it
                    fundamentally does not contribute to you learning anything new. Be careful about this way of
                    <strong><em>faking productivity</em></strong> because despite leaving you with a feeling that you are
                    doing something beneficial you are actually wasting your time.
                </p>
                <p>It is also important that you limit the amount of technology you use as you engage in the deliberate
                    practice of your skill. While technology is a good tool for the preparation or review of learned
                    material, a computer's many functions can unfortunately also serve as a huge distraction. Being aware of
                    this made me, a computer science student write down code on paper whenever learning about new concepts
                    and algorthims, forcing me to mentally visualize the output and more deeply understand what I was
                    writing.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Teaching yourself a new skill is a rewarding and empowering experience that can open up a world of
                    opportunities. By adopting the right mindset, setting realistic goals, choosing the right resources,
                    creating a learning plan, practicing deliberately, overcoming challenges, leveraging technology
                    properly, and engaging with communities, you can achieve mastery in any skill you set your mind to.
                    Remember that the journey of self-education is a marathon, not a sprint, and that every challenge
                    you
                    face is an opportunity for growth and improvement. So, go ahead, take the first step, and embark on
                    your
                    journey of self-discovery and lifelong learning.</p>
                <p>Good luck!</p>
