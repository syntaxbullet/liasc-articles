            <h1>State of the Server. Plans for a better future.</h1>
            <p>
                Hello everyone! I am writing this article to give you an update on the current state of the server and to share some plans for the future that will hopefully make your experience on the server better than it currently is. I have been absent for a while for work and examination related reasons, but I am back now and ready to make some changes. Moving the server forward with those that decided not to leave.
            </p>

            <h4>What exactly happened?</h4>
            <p>Well... currently I am having my exams, on top of working part-time. That makes it difficult for me to show activity on the server. Moderate some of the trashtalk and implement the suggestions from the community. Because of that, the promised but not started event and other reasons many people have already left the server.</p>
            <h6>What happened to the Web Development Event?</h6>
            <p>As I got more and more busy, pre-recording some of the educational content I had planned for the event simply became impossible. I wanted to edit the recordings of this event in order to create something watchable even after the event has passed, but I figured If I didn't have time to record and edit the hour-long videos it might be better to postpone the event until I can make sure the learning resources I can provide to you are good enough...</p>
            <h4>What now?</h4>
            <p>In order to combat the slow death of the server and introduce some more exciting activity and events I will be following an action-plan over the next 2 months with the goal of reaching 100 members.</p>
            <h6>Moderator Applications</h6>
            <p>Firstly, I will be opening up moderator applications to the community. This will allow me to delegate some of the responsibilities of moderating the server to other members of the community, helping me to focus on other aspects of the server which require my attention. Despite this I promise to not become less active overall, fulfilling my role as a responsible owner.<p>
            <h6>YouTube Shorts</h6>
            <p>Secondly, I will be putting in consistent and significant effort to procude short-form content on YouTube shorts with the goal of promoting this server and giving some members of this server something to look forward to. The shorts will be focused on simple strategies you can apply in your daily life in order to save time, process your emotions and become a better version of yourself.</p>
            <h4>About off-topic discussions</h4>
            <p>I realize that a majority of the server's activity can be attributed to the off-topic conversations going on. This is partially due to the main topic of this server being centered around self-improvement which most individuals do not engage with consistently for a majority of their day, instead self-improvement is something most people spend a very small amount of time on...</p>

            <p>With that being said, I believe that the majority of the actual value that the server can provide to it's members is centered around self-improvement or emotional development topics. Please consider starting new threads in the serious-general channel, or start valuable debates in the upcoming debates channel... Over the next few weeks, I will be working on creating more channels that are centered around self-improvement and emotional development topics. I will also be working on creating more events that are centered around these topics. I hope that these changes will help to make the server a more engaging and exciting place for all of you, without losing the fun and off-topic conversations that you all enjoy.</p>
             </p>
            
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>With the above changes, I hope to make the server a more engaging and exciting place for all of you. I am excited to see how these changes will impact the server and I am looking forward to hearing your feedback on them. If you have any suggestions or ideas for how we can improve the server, please feel free to share them with me. I am always open to new ideas and I want to make sure that the server is a place where everyone feels welcome and supported.</p>
